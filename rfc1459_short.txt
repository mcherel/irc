IRC (Internet Relay Chat):
 - using the TCP/IP network protocol
 - through the use of the client-server model
 - single process (the server) forming a central point for clients (or other servers)
Server(s):
 - providing a point to which clients may connect
 - forming an IRC network
 - server acts as a central node
Client(s):
 - anything connecting to a server that is not another server
 - distinguished from other clients by a unique nickname having a maximum length of nine (9) characters
 - information to probvide to the server:
    - the real name of the host that the client is running on
    - the username of the client on that host
    - the server to which the client is connected
Server Operator(s) (?)
 - should be able to disconnect and reconnect servers (SQUIT && CONNECT)
 - to  remove  a user  from  the connected network by 'force' (KILL)
Channel(s)
 - is a named group of one or more clients which will all receive messages addressed to that channel
 - is created implicitly when the first client joins it
 - ceases to exist when the last client leaves it
 - if it exists, any client can reference the channel using the name of the channel
 - channel names :
    - beginning with a '&' or '#' character (to define)
    - length up to 200 characters

        - no comma (',' which is used as a list item separator by the protocol)
 - JOIN to create or join a channel 
    - if the channel doesn't exist :
        - prior to joining, the channel is created
        - the creating user becomes a channel operator
    - if the channel already exists :
        - see modes (i, t, k, o)
        - if the channel is invite-only, (+i), then you may only join if invited
